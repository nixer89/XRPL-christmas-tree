# Remote controlling the christmas tree
This is only possible during a live event (also known as live stream).
Outside of live streams, no remote control is possible! Your sent funds won't have any effect but they are still getting forwarded to @GoodXrp!

All proceeds going to @GoodXrp!

# How to remote control my christmas tree:

## via `XRP Ledger` transaction ( instant - almost :-] ):
### turn on:
- send 0.5 XRP via XRPL to `rNixerUVPwrhxGDt4UooDu6FJ7zuofvjCF`
### turn off:
- send 1 XRP via XRPL to `rNixerUVPwrhxGDt4UooDu6FJ7zuofvjCF`
### party mode:
- send 0.5 XRP via XRPL to `XVN5ZDcAd6bW8Nu3sMJMYfkFHyxUxmobRHUahW1QjXEJnp7` ( you don't know what that is? visit: [https://xrpaddress.info/](https://xrpaddress.info/)

## via `@xrptipbot` transaction (delay up to 1 minute!)
### turn on:
- send 0.5 XRP via @xrptipbot to @XRP_IoT_Tree
### turn off:
- send 1 XRP via @xrptipbot to @XRP_IoT_Tree
### party mode:
- send 1.337 XRP via @xrptipbot to @XRP_IoT_Tree


Party Mode: can't be turned off and will run at least 3 minutes
